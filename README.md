# Vagatasktracker-BE

Backend of a small app to store tasks and deadlines that sends notifications minutes before the deadline.

- Web API with endpoints to handle tasks.
- Background services: not the first one I build from scratch, but wanted to do so in a personal project.
- SignalR: used to notify users of a task reaching the deadline in the background service.
